    "\n",
    "*   Implement at least two computational models relevant for your hypothesis. *(3 points)*\n",
    "*   Simulate behavior from the two models. *(3 points)*\n",
    "*   Implement a procedure for fitting the models to data. *(4 points)*\n",
    "*   Implement a procedure for parameter recovery. *(5 points)*\n",
    "*   (Implement a procedure for model recovery.) *(optional; 2 bonus points)*\n",

    "## Questions to ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. can we compare two model-free methods?\n",
    "Yes, as long as we explain why we chose those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. should reward probabilities be random or task-specific? Are they fixed ahead of time? Do they change between trials, do the probabilities depend on what the user chose?\n",
    "3. are we using a single subject's data, or combining multiple people's data and modelling that collectively?\n",
    "4. what is \"the set of parameters\"? what are we trying to model? are we trying to discover alpha, gamma? are reward probabilities something we should model?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Todo for us:\n",
    "1. Get simulation data from CSV\n",
    "2. Decide which parameters to model\n",
    "3. Update model training to use simulation data from the CSV\n",
    "4. generate data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics for 19/2:\n",
    "1. Status of [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZE8gojf_xb3gKliFXxrriefad8ysWFBFxYyAyXw8gw/edit)\n",
    "2. Visualization of data: what to graph? reward probabilities? user behavior?"
